A small Reverse Shell for android.
Nothing special, no bells and whistles.
It basically reads for "command_url" and posts results to "result_url".
(Both of these strings should be defined in res/values/strings.xml before building the apk).
I have also added sample php based server code [Warning: It does not have any sort of authentication as of now].
